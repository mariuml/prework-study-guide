# Prework Study Guide Webpage 

## Description

This Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, git and JavaScript.

This allows bootcamp students to store their notes in an easy to find place. I learnt how to create a structure of a website with HTML, style with CSS and create a random study topic selector with Javascript.

## Usage
To use the Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section.

For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (MacOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows).

A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from Prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
